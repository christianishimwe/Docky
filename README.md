# Docky: GPT-Powered Code Snippets for Documentation

Docky is a Chrome Extension that enhances documentation sites by injecting AI-generated code examples directly into the page. Whether you're a beginner trying to understand a new API or an experienced developer looking for quick cross-language translations, Docky gives you contextual, tailored code snippets on demand right where you need them.

## 🚀 Project Description

Documentation is essential but often lacks practical examples that speak to the reader’s current needs. Docky solves this by:

- Extracting content from the page you’re on (e.g., function name, class, method)
- Allowing you to specify language and complexity level
- Generating and injecting AI-powered code snippets without leaving the site

Docky acts like a personal assistant for documentation, turning static pages into interactive learning tools.
